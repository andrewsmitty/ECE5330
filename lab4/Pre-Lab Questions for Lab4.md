# Pre-Lab Questions for Lab3

### 1.  Assume you are using all of the LEDs (RGB and the 4 red LEDs), the 7-segment display, the LCD screen, the keypad, and the external interrupt button. Which GPIO pins are available to be used as an external input. (i.e. determine which GPIO pins are being used by the peripherals listed above, these are unavailable for other use) 



### 2. There are 4 General Purpose I/O External interrupts (source IP is GPIO). List the Interrupt Name and which pins can be used with them (see TRM).  



### 3. Which driver would be the logical source of interrupt functions for the above interrupts? List one function provided by the driver that would allow you to setup an external interrupt. (see DrvX.c) 



### 4. Write a fragment of code to read an external input from pin GPA_6 and assign the value to LED_0 (GPC_12).  



### 5. Write a fragment of c-code to use the keypad to provide the start, stop and reset buttons
